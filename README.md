# Machine Translation Project

## Introduction
In this notebook, we will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

- **Preprocess** - Convert text to sequence of integers.
- **Models** Create models which accepts a sequence of integers as input and returns a probability distribution over possible translations. After learning about the basic types of neural networks that are often used for machine translation, you will engage in your own investigations, to design your own model!
- **Prediction** Run the model on English text.
